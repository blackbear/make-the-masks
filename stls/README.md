| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| | [J.Scott Mask](jscott "J.Scott")     | Variation of the original Montana design with slightly lofted mouth area and large eyelets, as well as letters for sizing. Currently recommended design | 2h36m      |
| | [Montata Mask](montana-mask "Montana")     | The original Montana Mask, now with flanged filter section | 2h34m      |
|<img src="https://github.com/blackbear/make-the-masks/blob/master/images/texasfull.jpg?raw=true" width="100"> | [Texas Style](texas "Texas")     | Slower to print than simple mask, but offers more airflow and will probably work better for oval N95 filters | 3h31m      |
