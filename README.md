Repository of design files for Make the Masks and remixes

Welcome to the source repository for the Make the Masks effort. If you haven't yet, we encourage you to check out the main
website at http://www.makethemasks.com/, and get in touch with a local coordinator in your area.

If you are sending out masks, we suggest you include a copy of [this letter](documents/maskletter.docx) here, after you customize
it without your contact information and change the section on filters as appropriate.
